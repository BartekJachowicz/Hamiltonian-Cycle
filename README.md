# Hamiltonian-Cycle

#Project for bacheor degree


Project will contain algorithms for Hamiltonian cycle problem:
- brut force algorithm
- Inclusion Exclusion principle algorithm
- dynamic algoritm
- naive approach on treewidth decomposition
- rank based approach with Gaussian Elimination on treewidth decomposition

and also a tests for this algorithms.
